              <h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
              <p>
                Players take on the role of individual characters. These
                characters are very light mechanically, but very rich
                thematically. Their mechanical elements are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Blessings</li>
                <li>Ruin</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                They tend to be good at a few things, which we call Blessings.
                Blessings are often single words or short phrases, like
                athletics or spirits. Importantly, having a relevant Blessing
                gives a player an extra die during certain rolls, and may give
                them fictional permission to attempt something they would not
                otherwise be able to do. In Basilisk, the characters are
                treasure-hunters who have a few Blessings provided to them by
                their Occupation (what they do now) or Background (what they
                used to be or do). This is one of the ways we allow players and
                their characters their own individual moments to shine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because Basilisk takes place in a science-fantasy setting, the
                characters have access to supernatural abilities called
                Psionics. Because using Psionics requires rolling risky dark
                dice, they are one of the ways that a character can increase
                their Ruin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ruin is a number between 1 and 4 which tracks a character’s
                descent. Nearly every roll that a player makes has a chance to
                affect their character’s Ruin. At 4 Ruin, a character is removed
                from play.
              </p>
              <h1>GAME MATERIALS</h1>
              <h2>Dice</h2>
              Basilisk uses two different colors of four-sided dice: light dice
              and dark dice. Light dice are typically less risky, whereas dark
              dice are typically more risky. Players may make rolls using dice
              of just one type or the other, but it’s common to roll one or two
              of each during a single roll. The individual rolls (described
              below) will tell you which dice to use when.
              <h2>Tokens</h2>
              Characters might gain delve tokens which they can exchange to achieve
              immediate goals. Any coins or beads work well as counters.
              <h1>COMPLICATIONS</h1>
              <h2>Delve</h2>
              <p>
                When you press ever deeper in pursuit of a specific and
                immediate goal, taking a risk or investigating, say how you are
                exploring your environment, then gather 4-sided dice. 
                <ul>
                  <li>Take one light-colored die just for exploring the world and asking the GM questions about it.</li>
                  <li>Take another light die if you have a Skill or piece of equipment that would make your delve easier.</li>
                  <li>Add a dark-colored die for risking your character’s mind or body in order to succeed. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Roll the dice. If your highest die is a: 
                  </p>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You lose all your tokens, and encounter something terrible
                </li>
                <li>You encounter something terrible.</li>
                <li>Take 1 delve token, but you encounter something terrible.</li>
                <li>Take 1 delve token.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>If your highest die was the dark dice, it counts as a Ruin Roll</p>
              <p>
                Spend 1 token to find something valuable. Spend 3 tokens to
                achieve your goal.
              </p>
              <h2>Help</h2>
              If a player’s dice pool includes one dark die, your character may
              offer help to improve their odds of success (either before or
              after they roll). If they accept your offer, say how you expose
              yourself to danger and roll one light die. They may include your
              light die's result when considering their overall success. But if
              your light die's result matches any of the dark dice in their
              roll, your own Ruin increases by 1. You may only suffer a maximum
              of 1 Ruin when helping on a roll. This is particularly relevant
              when a player re-rolls a Risk Roll. The helping player doesn’t
              re-roll their light die. However, you still increase your Ruin by
              1 if any re-rolled dice show the same number as your light die
              (provided you haven’t increased Ruin by 1 already). More than one
              player may offer to help, in which case each player rolls their
              own light die. The helped player can incorporate all of the light
              dice into their own Risk Roll.
              <h2>Ruin</h2>
              Your Ruin shows how much
              physical and mental harm your character has suffered. It starts at
              1. When your character witnesses or undergoes something
              disturbing, make a Ruin Roll by rolling one dark die. If you’ve
              made a Hunt Roll which includes a dark die, and that die is equal
              to or higher than your highest light die in that roll, your dark
              die is automatically considered a Ruin Roll. If you rolled higher
              than your current Ruin, increase your Ruin by 1 and work with the
              GM to describe how the Basilisk warps your mind and body. 
              <h2>Reduction</h2>
              When your Ruin reaches 3, you may now reduce it by
              acting in the interests of the Basilisk: destroying treasure,
              preventing the use of Psionics, or sabotaging the other
              characters’ exit to safety. You should do these acts in a way that
              does not draw attention to yourself. The more it looks like an
              accident or simple bad luck, the better. Each time you act in the
              Basilisk's interest, roll one light die. If you rolled less than
              your current Ruin, your betrayal goes unnoticed and you decrease
              your Ruin by 1. If you rolled higher than or equal to your Ruin,
              you may still choose to reduce your Ruin by 1, but someone will
              notice your attempted betrayal. You may continue reducing your
              Ruin in this way when your Ruin drops below 3, until you have 1
              Ruin. 
              <h1>HORRORS</h1>
              <p>
              When you attempt to defeat the threats of the
              Basilisk or attempt to face a horror head on, you may combine
              efforts with your companions. 
            </p> <p>
              First say how you expose yourself to
              injury or attack or say how your character's psychically
              vulnerable, past trauma or surreal, eerie experiences. Then roll a
              single light die.</p>
              <p>
              The number on the die is called your Weak Point,
              and represents the risks you’re taking to face the threat. If
              multiple characters are involved, each rolls their own die. Now
              gather a dark die for each character involved in the attack. Roll
              all the dark dice together. </p>
              <p>
              To defeat the threat (or group of
              threats), you must roll against the threat's Endurance, which is a
              number between 2 and 8. The GM may reduce the Endurance if you
              have relevant Skills or are taking advantage of your equipment,
              environment, or the threat's Weakness in some way. If the
              Endurance would go below the number of dark dice being rolled,
              then no Combat Roll is required. The GM may increase the Endurance
              if the threat is particularly tough, or if you are at a
              disadvantage. If the Endurance would go above 8, the threat is too
              difficult to fight and you must retreat, or find a way to reduce
              the threat’s Endurance.</p>
              <p>
              If the total of the two highest dark dice
              is equal to or higher than the Endurance, the threat is defeated
              in the manner you and your fellow players describe. 
            </p><p>
              If any of the
              dark dice equals your Weak Point, your character’s Ruin increases
              by 1 for each dark die matching the Weak Point. If the two highest
              dark dice are less than the threat’s Endurance and you wish to
              continue the attack, add one more dark die and re-roll all the
              dark dice. 
            </p>
              <p>
              You may keep adding a dark die and re-rolling until the
              total of the two highest dark dice is equal to or higher than the
              Endurance, or until you give up the fight. Retreating from an
              incomplete fight may trigger Risk Rolls or other consequences. 
            </p>
              <h1>LOSING YOUR CHARACTER</h1>
              When your Ruin reaches 4, your character is
              lost. This is an important moment: Everyone focuses on your
              character’s last flashes of lucidity before they run away or turn
              against their companions. The GM may allow you to take on a co-GM
              role, helping describe the terrors of the world—especially any
              terrors that directly connect to your now-lost character.
